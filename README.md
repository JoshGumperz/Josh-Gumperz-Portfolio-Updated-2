# Josh-Gumperz-Portfolio-Updated-2

**Please note**
This portfolio is NOT up to date. You can find an up to date version of my full portfolio here: https://github.com/JoshGumperz/React-Portfolio

The goal of this assignment is to create a portfolio website with some information about myself, as well as a section dedicated to some of the work I've done, and a contact me section with my contact information.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need in order to view the site is a device with internet connection and a browser!

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like as you scroll through. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look! Please note:
- Code has been properly restyled for smaller screens
- All clickable links have been indicated as such by changing the cursor to a pointer upon hovering over a link
- All images have a descriptive alt attribute
- Document has a descriptive title
- Descriptive comments are present in index.html and style.css
