                <p> Hi my name is Josh Gumperz, I'm 20 years old, and I am an aspiring software developer. I grew up around computers and tech, and as such I've always had a passion for the computers and tech industry. I even built my own computer when I was 15. 
                
                When I graduated highschool, I knew I wanted to do work in the tech industry, but I didn't know exactly which field I wanted to work in. So I took an IT training class which taught me how to troubleshoot and repair computers and work with computer hardware. I then did an internship at a local computer repair shop in Alameda. I learned a lot during my time as an IT student but ultimately decided it wasn't for me and that I would rather do something more software oriented instead. 

                During the 2020 pandemic I did self training using resources such as CodeAcademy to teach myself some Python, before eventually commiting to do a full-stack web development coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension in summer of 2021. I'm now working towards my long term goal of becoming a software developer!
                    
                Outside of coding I have several interests and hobbies including: playing games with friends such as Rocket League, League of Legends, Valorant, Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, NBA2k, Fifa, and even Chess. Watching and sometimes playing sports. I'm a big sports fan, and find almost every sport entertaining. My favorite sports to watch are Basketball and Soccer.
                    
                One interesting fact about me is that during the 2020 pandemic, I made some big lifestyle changes and ended up losing 140 pounds in a year. I'm still not quite at my weight goal, but I know I will be soon. </p>
